# Calculator

## EN

Another calculator that no one needed, implemented as part of my personal learning project. It was written in C++ using the GTK3 library.

**So you can compile it yourself by cloning the project first:**

`git clone https://github.com/surfpunkk/Calculator`

**Next, you should to make a directory in the cloned project and build app using CMakeList.txt (you must have CMake installed):**

`mkdir build && cmake -B build -G Ninja`

**Then forward to directory build and run ninja:**

`cd build/ && ninja`
